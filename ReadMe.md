*My garden is still growing, but it's so nice to meet you~*

## __I am a PharmD turned SWE.  ðŸ’Š :fast_forward: :computer:__

I am open for work or any opportunities that will utilize me as an engineer who helps others. To "serve those who serve others," as Simon Sinek said.

Ultimately, I want to use these acquired skills to make life easier and more fulfilling for other professionals, whether that is through healthtech / biotech, DevOps, or change â€“ or whether those "others" are also healthcare providers or other engineers.

* _**Currently** â€“ I am upgrading my Spotify desktop clone [Versify](https://github.com/imartinez921/versify_full-stack) to a newer tech stack._

* _**Most recently** â€“ in October 2023, I finished my first Hackathon submission, [SALE-E](https://sale-e-w-supabase.vercel.app/). [(Demo video here)](https://vimeo.com/875813744?share=copy)_

* _**My next goal is** â€“ to master Python for my upcoming interviews and to collaborate on more full-stack projects._
