*Thanks for stopping by! My garden is still growing, but it's nice to meet you~*

__I am a PharmD turned SWE.__

As I'm just starting out, I am open for any work or learning opportunities that will help me become a better engineer.... Ultimately, I see myself using my skills and dedication to make life easier and more fulfilling for others, whether that is through biotech, education, or climate change â€“ or whether those "others" are also healthcare providers or other engineers.

_**Currently** â€“ I am upgrading my Spotify desktop clone [Versify](https://github.com/imartinez921/versify_full-stack) to a newer tech stack._

_**Most recently** â€“ in October 2023, I finished my first Hackathon submission, [SALE-E](https://sale-e-w-supabase.vercel.app/). [(Demo video here)](https://vimeo.com/875813744?share=copy)_

_**My next goal is** â€“ to master Python for my upcoming interviews and to collaborate on more full-stack projects.... So please reach out to me!_
