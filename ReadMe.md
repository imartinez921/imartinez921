## PharmD-turned-SWE.  ðŸ’Š :fast_forward: :computer:
**Bootcamp graduate with 1.5 yrs experience building full-stack apps in JavaScript & Ruby.**
I am passionate about service, self-growth, collaboration, & debugging. I use my curiosity & empathy to design products from scratch centered on the customerâ€™s needs & perspective, and I like to work on teams & solve problems. I am looking to work for a company who can amplify my efforts in serving a mission of positive social impact.

**As Simon Sinek says, I want to "serve those who serve others."**

_**Currently** â€“ I am drilling data structures & algorithms problems to prep for my interviews._

_**Most recently** â€“ I finally finished my solo project, my Spotify web clone named [Versify](https://github.com/imartinez921/versify_full-stack), built with PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, and React-Redux._

_**My next goal is** â€“ to gather more collaboration and teamwork experience developing through volunteer and open-source projects._
