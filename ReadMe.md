*My garden is still growing, but it's so nice to meet you~*

## __I am a PharmD turned SWE.  ðŸ’Š :fast_forward: :computer:__

I am open for work or any opportunities that will utilize me as an engineer who helps others â€“
<br>to _"serve those who serve others,"_ as Simon Sinek said.

Ultimately, I want to use these acquired skills to make life easier and more fulfilling for other professionals, whether that is through healthtech / biotech, DevOps, or work in the non-profit sector â€“ and whether those "others" are also fellow healthcare providers or other engineers.

* _**Currently** â€“ I am finishing my Spotify web clone [Versify](https://github.com/imartinez921/versify_full-stack), built with PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, and React/Redux._

* _**Most recently** â€“ in October 2023, I finished my first hackathon submission, SALE-E, built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Google AI (Vertex AI/PaLM AI API). [(Demo video here)](https://vimeo.com/875813744?share=copy)_

* _**My next goal is** â€“ to master Python for my upcoming interviews and to collaborate more through group projects, open-source, or volunteerwork._
